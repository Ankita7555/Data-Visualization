# Data Visualization Projects

This repository contains a collection of data visualization assignments and projects completed as part of my Master’s coursework in Computer Science. The work focuses on transforming raw data into meaningful insights through exploratory analysis, statistical visualization, and clear visual storytelling using real-world datasets.

## Contents

### 1. Data Visualization Assignments
A set of academic assignments covering different types of charts and graphs, created to understand best practices in visual analytics and data interpretation.

Includes:
- Bar charts, line charts, scatter plots, and histograms  
- Box plots and distribution analysis  
- Time-series visualizations  
- Comparative and trend-based charts  
- Visualization design principles (color, scale, labeling, readability)

These assignments emphasize clarity, correctness, and effective communication of insights.

### 2. R Code for Data Visualization
R scripts used for data cleaning, transformation, analysis, and visualization.

Key aspects:
- Data preprocessing and filtering  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Statistical summaries and visual interpretation  
- Reproducible visualization workflows  
- Use of common R visualization libraries (e.g., ggplot-style plotting)

The code is structured to be readable, modular, and reusable for similar analytical tasks.

### 3. Chicago Divvy Bike Share – Final Project
A comprehensive final project analyzing the Chicago Divvy bike-share dataset using historical trip data.

Project highlights:
- Analysis of large-scale real-world transportation data  
- Data cleaning and handling of missing or inconsistent records  
- User behavior analysis across different time periods  
- Seasonal and temporal trend analysis  
- Visualization-driven insights for business and operational decision-making  

The project demonstrates an end-to-end workflow from raw data ingestion to insight generation using visual analytics.
